{"google":"","tagline":"","body":"### Algorithm Design by _Jon Kleinberg_ and _Éva Tardos_\r\nPeripatetic Shipping Lines, inc., is a shipping company that owns n ships\r\nand provides service to n ports. Each of its ships has a schedule that says,\r\nfor each day of the month, which of the ports it’s currently visiting, or\r\nwhether it’s out at sea. (You can assume the \"month\" here has m days,\r\nfor some m > n.) Each ship visits each port for exactly one day during the\r\nmonth. For safety reasons, PSL Inc. has the following strict requirement:\r\n(t) No two ships can be in the same port on the same day.\r\nThe company wants to perform maintenance on all the ships this\r\nmonth, via the following scheme. They want to truncate each ship’s\r\nschedule: for each ship Sg, there will be some day when it arrives in its\r\nscheduled port and simply remains there for the rest of the month (for\r\nmaintenance). This means that S~ will not visit the remaining ports on\r\nits schedule (if any) that month, but this is okay. So the truncation of\r\nS~’s schedule will simply consist of its original schedule up to a certain\r\nspecified day on which it is in a port P; the remainder of the truncated\r\nschedule simply has it remain in port P.\r\nNow the company’s question to you is the following: Given the sched-\r\nule for each ship, find a truncation of each so that condition (t) continues\r\nto hold: no two ships are ever in the same port on the same day.\r\nShow that such a set of truncations can always be found, and give an\r\nalgorithm to find them.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nSuppose we have two ships and two ports, and the \"month\" has\r\nfour days. Suppose the first ship’s schedule is\r\n\r\n> _port P1; at sea; port P2; at sea_\r\n\r\nand the second ship’s schedule is\r\n\r\n> _at sea; port P1; at sea; port P2_\r\n\r\nThen the (only) way to choose truncations would be to have the first ship\r\nremain in port Pz starting on day 3, and have the second ship remain in\r\nport P1 starting on day 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
